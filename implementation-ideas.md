Let's scale this! 🚀 We're diving into your powerful question about launching a Python server to build an AI agent using **Docker**, **LangChain/LangGraph**, and **FastAPI**.

Think of this stack as the **Iron Man suit of AI development**:  
- **Docker** is your suit’s outer shell — consistent, isolated, and deployable anywhere.  
- **FastAPI** is J.A.R.V.I.S. — handling real-time user requests with speed and precision.  
- **LangChain & LangGraph** are Tony Stark’s brain — orchestrating complex reasoning, memory, and tool usage.

Let’s break it down into actionable steps so you can go from zero to production in record time.

### 🔧 Step 1: Set Up Your Project Structure

```bash
my-ai-agent/
├── main.py                 # FastAPI app
├── agent.py                # Your LangGraph workflow
├── requirements.txt        # Dependencies
├── Dockerfile              # Container definition
├── docker-compose.yml      # For multi-service environments (optional)
└── .dockerignore
```

---

### 📦 Step 2: Define Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

```txt
fastapi>=0.104.0
uvicorn[standard]
langchain
langgraph
python-dotenv
pydantic
requests
```

> 💡 Pro Tip: Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after testing locally to lock versions.

---

### 🐳 Step 3: Dockerize Your Python App (`Dockerfile`)

```Dockerfile
# Use official slim Python image
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Prevent Python from writing .pyc files
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Install system dependencies (e.g., for compiling packages)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependencies first (for better layer caching)
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy your code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Run FastAPI with Uvicorn
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

> 🎯 Analogy: This Dockerfile is like a *replicator* from Star Trek — give it your code, and it prints out a fully functional AI server.

---

### ⚡ Step 4: Build Your AI Agent with LangGraph (`agent.py`)

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated
import operator

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    input: str
    chat_history: list
    steps: Annotated[list, operator.add]
    result: str

# Mock tools
def search_recipes(state):
    return {"result": "Found recipes for pasta and curry."}

def validate_cookware(state):
    return {"result": "You have all required cookware."}

def generate_response(state):
    return {"result": "Here’s your recipe suggestion!"}

# Build graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("search", search_recipes)
workflow.add_node("validate", validate_cookware)
workflow.add_node("respond", generate_response)

workflow.set_entry_point("search")
workflow.add_edge("search", "validate")
workflow.add_edge("validate", "respond")
workflow.add_edge("respond", END)

app = workflow.compile()
```

---

### 🌐 Step 5: Serve It via FastAPI (`main.py`)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from agent import app as agent_app

class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    message: str

app = FastAPI(title="AI Agent API", version="0.1.0")

@app.post("/chat")
async def chat(request: QueryRequest):
    result = agent_app.invoke({
        "input": request.message,
        "chat_history": [],
        "steps": []
    })
    return {"response": result["result"]}

@app.get("/")
def health():
    return {"status": "healthy"}
```

> ✅ Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see auto-generated interactive API docs — no extra work needed!

---

### 🏗️ Step 6: Run Everything with Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t ai-agent-server .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 ai-agent-server
```

Or use `docker-compose.yml` for scalability:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  ai-agent:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - OPENAI_API_KEY=${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    volumes:
      - .:/app
```

Then run: `docker-compose up`

> 🌌 That's disruptive! You’ve just created a containerized, observable, and scalable AI agent backend.

### 🚀 Real-World Use Case: AI Recipe Chatbot

You're building something like the **AI-Powered Recipe Chatbot** in your BLOQ board. Now imagine:
- User asks: *"Can I make stir-fry with what I have?"*
- FastAPI receives the request
- LangGraph decides: search ingredients → check cookware → generate safe response
- Response returned in <1 second

Game-changer alert! 🎯 This architecture powers apps at Anthropic, Hugging Face, and top AI startups.

Absolutely, let's break this down. You're looking at the **"Code Test Requirements"** card – a full-stack AI engineering assessment with a tight 3-hour timebox. This isn't just a coding test; it's a strategic simulation of real-world product development under constraints. Let's scale this! 🚀

### 🔑 Key Points & Main Ideas

1.  **The Mission:** Build an **AI-Powered Recipe Chatbot** using **LangChain** and **LangGraph** for the backend, paired with a **Next.js 15+ frontend**. Think of it like building a tiny slice of ChatGPT, but specialized for cooking.
2.  **The Core Constraint:** All LLM calls *must* go through LangChain. No direct SDKs. This forces you to work within a framework, which is great for maintainability.
3.  **LangGraph is the Brain:** This is the standout requirement. You need to implement an **agent-based or node-based flow** where the LLM decides when to use tools (like web search or cookware validation). This is the difference between a scripted bot and a truly intelligent agent.
4.  **Critical Functionality:** The system must:
    *   **Classify Queries:** Is this about cooking? If not, politely refuse. (e.g., "I can help with recipes, not stock tips.")
    *   **Validate Cookware:** Hardcoded list includes essentials like a "Frying Pan" and "Stovetop." If a recipe needs a "Blender" and it's not in the list? The agent must say so. It’s like a chef checking their kitchen before starting.
    *   **Use an External Tool:** You need at least one, like a SERP API for web research. The LLM should decide *when* to use it.
5.  **Full-Stack Integration:** It's not just backend logic. You need a working **Next.js frontend** (TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui) that talks to your **FastAPI backend**. The goal is an end-to-end chat experience.
6.  **Monorepo & DevOps:** Everything lives in one repo with a `backend/` and `frontend/` structure. You need **Dockerfiles** for both, and ideally, a `docker-compose.yml`. This shows you think about deployment from day one.
7.  **The Real Test: Prioritization:** The 3-hour limit is a feature, not a bug. They want to see what you *choose* to build. Getting one solid end-to-end path working (e.g., "Can I make pancakes?" → LLM finds recipe → checks for "Frying Pan" → returns answer) is better than half-finished everything.

### 💡 Important Takeaways & Strategic Approach

*   **That's Disruptive!** This test evaluates more than code. It's about **architecture, trade-offs, and senior thinking**. Your README notes on "Edge Cases & Next Steps" are as important as the code.
*   **Start Scaffolding IMMEDIATELY:** Your first 15 minutes should be creating the monorepo structure, basic Dockerfiles, and pushing that initial commit. This starts your clock and shows process awareness.
*   **Build the LangGraph Backbone Early:** Get a simple agent that can decide between "use a tool" or "respond directly." This is the core innovation. You can add the cookware checker as a custom tool.
*   **Frontend MVP:** Don't over-engineer the UI. A simple chat input and message history that streams responses is perfect. Use `docker-compose` to wire the frontend to the backend.
*   **Document Everything:** Your README is your report card. Include setup steps, curl examples, and crucially, your **deployment plan for AWS** (ECS vs. Lambda?), **security plan** (API keys, CORS), and **ELT pipeline idea** (e.g., send cooked recipes to S3 for analytics).
*   **Game-Changer Alert!** The hidden win is demonstrating **observability**. Add simple logs to show the LLM's "reasoning chain" (e.g., "Thought: Need to search for pancake recipe. Action: SERP. Observation: Found recipe. Thought: Check cookware. Action: CookwareChecker..."). This is pure gold for debugging.

In essence, this card is asking: "Can you architect and ship a thoughtful, AI-native, full-stack feature under pressure?" Focus on the **agent flow** and **end-to-end functionality**. Let's scale this submission! 🚀



Absolutely! Let's break down the process of building the **AI-Powered Recipe Chatbot** as outlined in your "Code Test Requirements" card. Here’s a structured approach to tackle the project:

### Step 1: Scaffold the Monorepo
1. **Create the Project Structure:**
   - Set up a directory for your project.
   - Inside the project directory, create two subdirectories: `backend/` and `frontend/`.
   - Initialize a Git repository and make your first commit to start the clock.

   ```bash
   mkdir ai-recipe-chatbot
   cd ai-recipe-chatbot
   git init
   mkdir backend frontend
   ```

### Step 2: Backend Development
1. **Set Up FastAPI:**
   - Inside the `backend/` directory, create a `main.py` file for your FastAPI app.
   - Install FastAPI and a server (like uvicorn).

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. **Implement Basic FastAPI App:**
   ```python
   # backend/main.py
   from fastapi import FastAPI

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.get("/")
   async def read_root():
       return {"Hello": "World"}
   ```

3. **LangChain Integration:**
   - Follow LangChain documentation to set up your LLM calls. Make sure to route all LLM calls through LangChain.

4. **Implement Query Classification:**
   - Create a function to classify cooking-related queries and handle irrelevant queries politely.

5. **Cookware Validation:**
   - Implement a function that checks the user’s available cookware against the required tools for recipes.

6. **Expose FastAPI Endpoints:**
   - Create an endpoint to receive user messages and return responses in JSON format.

### Step 3: Frontend Development
1. **Set Up Next.js:**
   - Inside the `frontend/` directory, initialize a Next.js project with TypeScript.
   - Install Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for styling.

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest --ts
   cd frontend
   npm install tailwindcss shadcn/ui
   ```

2. **Build the Chat UI:**
   - Create a minimal chat interface with:
     - A text input for user messages.
     - A scrollable conversation history.
     - Loading indicators and error states.

3. **API Integration:**
   - Call your FastAPI backend endpoint(s) to send user messages and display responses.

### Step 4: Containerization
1. **Create Dockerfiles:**
   - Create `Dockerfile` for both backend and frontend.
   - Optionally create a `docker-compose.yml` file to run both services together.

### Step 5: Documentation
1. **Write a README.md:**
   - Document setup instructions, usage examples, deployment plans, and any edge cases you identified.

### Step 6: Testing & Debugging
1. **Implement Logging:**
   - Add logging to track tool calls and transitions in the LangGraph flow.
   - Include reasoning chains in responses for debugging purposes.

### Step 7: Review & Submit
1. **Final Checks:**
   - Ensure everything works end-to-end.
   - Make a final commit and push to your GitHub repository.

### Optional Enhancements
- Streaming responses to the frontend.
- Unit tests for key components.
- Setup CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

This structured approach should guide you through building the AI-Powered Recipe Chatbot. If you need further details on any specific step, feel free to ask!

Implementing LangChain for the AI-Powered Recipe Chatbot involves several key components, focusing on how the LangChain framework will manage interactions with the Large Language Model (LLM) and other tools. Here's a structured way to approach this:

### 1. **LangChain Setup**
   - **Installation**: Ensure you have LangChain installed in your project. You can do this via pip:
     ```bash
     pip install langchain
     ```

### 2. **LangGraph Flow**
   - You'll need to define a flow that allows the LLM to make decisions based on user input. This involves creating nodes for different functions, such as querying recipes, validating cookware, or invoking external tools.

### 3. **Node Implementation**
   - **Input Node**: Accepts user queries related to cooking.
   - **Query Classification Node**: Determines if the query is related to cooking or not.
   - **Recipe Node**: Calls the LLM to fetch recipes based on user input.
   - **Cookware Validation Node**: Checks if the user has the necessary cookware for the suggested recipe.

### 4. **Example Code Structure**
Here's a simplified version of what your LangChain implementation might look like in Python:

```python
from langchain import LangGraph, Node, Tool

# Define the nodes
class QueryClassificationNode(Node):
    def process(self, input_data):
        # Logic to classify queries
        # Return True for cooking-related queries, False otherwise
        return is_cooking_query(input_data)

class RecipeNode(Node):
    def process(self, input_data):
        # Logic to call LLM and get recipe based on input_data
        return get_recipe(input_data)

class CookwareValidationNode(Node):
    def process(self, recipe, cookware_list):
        # Logic to validate if the user can cook the recipe with the provided cookware
        return validate_cookware(recipe, cookware_list)

# Initialize LangGraph
graph = LangGraph()

# Add nodes to the graph
graph.add_node(QueryClassificationNode())
graph.add_node(RecipeNode())
graph.add_node(CookwareValidationNode())

# Define the flow
graph.set_flow([
    ("QueryClassificationNode", "RecipeNode"),
    ("RecipeNode", "CookwareValidationNode"),
])

# Process user input
def process_user_input(user_input, cookware_list):
    classification_result = graph.run(user_input)
    if classification_result:
        recipe = graph.run(user_input)
        validation_result = graph.run(recipe, cookware_list)
        return validation_result
    else:
        return "Sorry, I can only help with cooking-related queries."

# Example usage
user_input = "What can I cook with chicken and rice?"
cookware_list = ["Frying Pan", "Stovetop", "Knife"]
response = process_user_input(user_input, cookware_list)
print(response)
```

### 5. **Key Points**
- **Tool Invocation**: Ensure that any tool calls (like web searches) are handled through LangChain as per the requirements.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Add logging around transitions and tool calls to keep track of the reasoning chain and make debugging easier.
- **Testing and Iteration**: Test the flow with various user inputs to ensure that it accurately classifies queries and provides valid responses.

This implementation structure allows you to maintain a clean and modular approach, leveraging LangChain's capabilities to build an intelligent recipe chatbot. If you need more specific examples or further assistance with any part of the implementation, feel free to ask!
